# Protein design

## Power of evolution 
1. Start with a sequence of a single organism  
  - Add a mutation 
2. Shuffling between species of the same gene 

## Native structures are conformational free energy minima 
- lower state 
- There are many degrees of freedom 
- There are a whole bunch of conformations 
- 2o^Nres Proteinsequenzen 
- Only a small number of combinations will fold reliably and fast 

## Why bother? 
- Basic research 
  - understanding sequence- structure-relations
- Enviroment 
  - biosensors, enzymes to clean up toxic compounds 
- Biotechnology and medicine
  - new enzymes and specificities
  - stability 
- Synthetic biology 
  - new chemisy, specificities and interfaces 

## Protein engineering and design approaches 
- Scaffold selection 
  - Natural protein 
    - Tryptophan repressor with pocket chhanged 
    - Ligand binding site and change it to oxyn repressor 
    - two fluorescent proteins and a conformational change makes a fred signal an interaction between both and you can meassure that 
- Cristal sturcture TrpR-wt bound to native ligand TRP 
- TrpR-wt bound to the design target IAA but with a very low affinity 
- S88Y introduced a large residue that pushes de Triptophan away and made it more specific for IAA but not por affine 
- Affinity is improved with 8 other mutations 
- Sequence optimisation 
  - Computational protein design 
  - Directed evolution 
- Functional protein 

### Summary 
Natural proteins can be repurposed by design.  
Specificity and affinity can be changed. 
Conformational changes can be used to trigger a readout. 
## De-novo design 

- TIM- barrel are mostly enzymes 
- You can define and parametarize 
- out in out in aminoacids

1. Where to start 
- Connections between alpha helices and beta strands 
- 4 beta strands with an alpha helix as conector 
- You feed to the Rosetta software 
  - find the conformational free energy minimum 

- triptophan wedges for keeping apart the beta sheets 
- 33 superfamilies in SCOPE 
  - psi-blast 3 iterations gives no hits to barrels 
  - only with hhpred you get hits 
- Extending the barrel 
  - what can it do, it folds but nothing more 
  - PSIPRED 

###Â Summary II 

-Idealized protein domains can be designed de novo 
- The designs cover new and unexplored sequence space 
- These "history-free" protein 


## Fragment-based design 

- Natural proteins evolved through duplicationa and recombination
- recombination also can happen it is not clear how often but it happens 
- We built new proteins from fragments of different folds 
  - HisF binds a double phosphorylated 

### How do all folds compare 

[Fuzzle data base for taking fragments and recombine](https://fuzzle.uni-bayreuth.de/)

- Design of protein chimeras with ProtLego 
1. Fetch fuzzle database 
2. Represent relationships 
3. Build chimeras 
4. Score chimeras 

### summary III 
Proteins evolved from subdomain sized fragments 
fragments- building complexity 
denovo- still difficult, structure 


foldit a game that makes you learn different parts
